# interchange

The **interchange** blockchain is built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and is created with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

## Get started

```
starport serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

## Configure

Configure your blockchain in development with `config.yml`. See the [Starport configuration](https://github.com/tendermint/starport/tree/develop/docs) docs.

## Launch

To launch your blockchain live on multiple nodes, use `starport network` commands. Learn more about [Starport Network](https://github.com/tendermint/spn).
